Title: Chat Room

Meetup events aren't the only time for chatting.  There's also a
\#sandiegopython IRC channel on Freenode as well as our Slack channel.
Sign on to ask questions, give answers, or just hang out.

### Slack

San Diego Python's Slack channel is available at
[pythonsd.slack.com](https://pythonsd.slack.com/). Use
[this page](https://pythonsd-slack.herokuapp.com/) to get an invite to create
your account.

### Web Client

If you haven't used IRC before, the fastest way to start is by using
the web client. You don't need to install anything on your computer for
this.

You'll need to choose a unique username and then you'll be put in the
\#sandiegopython channel on Freenode.  You can type by clicking in the
text box at the bottom and using your keyboard.

Visit the Web Client:
